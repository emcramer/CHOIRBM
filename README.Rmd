# CHOIRBM

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

CHOIRBM is a collection of plotting utilities for the [Collaborative Health Outcomes Information Registry's](http://www.choir.stanford.edu) Body Map (CBM). The CBM is an instrument for assessing the distribution of a patient's pain, and has been validated in a paper published in [_Pain Reports_ (Scherrer et al 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1097/pr9.0000000000000880). The package is built on top of the popular R plotting package `ggplot2`, and returns plots as ggplot objects.

```{r img, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/cbm-journal.jpeg")
```

## Installation

~~You can install the released version of CHOIRBM from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:~~ (Not on CRAN...yet)

``` r
install.packages("CHOIRBM")
```

Or install from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("emcramer/CHOIRBM")
remotes::install_github("emcramer/CHOIRBM")
```

## Examples
### Plotting the Male CBM
This is a basic example which shows you how to plot the front and back parts of the male CHOIR Body Map:

```{r male_example, fig.height=3}
library(CHOIRBM)

# generate some random example data
set.seed(123)
ids <- as.character(c(seq.int(101, 136, 1), seq.int(201, 238, 1)))
values <- data.frame(
  id = ids
  , value = runif(length(ids))
  , ucolors = rainbow(length(ids))
  , group = ifelse(as.numeric(ids) < 200, "Front", "Back")
)

# plot the data on the front of the CHOIR body map
plot_male_choirbm(values, "value")

# plot each segment of the bodymap as a different color
plot_male_choirbm(values, "ucolors")
```

### Plotting the female CBM
And an additional example with the female CHOIR Body Map:

```{r female_example, fig.height=3}
library(CHOIRBM)

# generate some random example data
exdata <- gen_example_data()

# plot the data on the front of the CHOIR body map
plot_female_choirbm(exdata, "value")
```

Check the vignettes for more examples such as plotting individual patients, highlighting specific segments, and changing color schemes.
